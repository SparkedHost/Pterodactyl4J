/**
 * Represents a value used in communication with relationship models
 *
 * <p>Methods that return an instance of Relationed require an additional step
 * to get the final result. Thus the user needs to append a follow-up method.
 *
 * <p>Certain Pterodactyl models allow for their relationships with other objects to be included in the
 * same request. For example, instead of retreving the {@link Node Node} of an
 * {@link ApplicationServer ApplicationServer} using the node id, you can include the
 * {@link Node Node} object in the same request that retrieved the
 * {@link ApplicationServer ApplicationServer}
 *
 * <p>However, you cannot include the relationship of a relationship object, like when attempting to get the
 * {@link ApplicationEgg ApplicationEgg} of an
 * {@link ApplicationServer ApplicationServer} from an
 * {@link ApplicationAllocation Allocation}. The egg relationship will not be included in server relationship from the allocation.
 * You will need to retrieve the egg instead.
 *
 * @param <T>
 *        An entity from an object's relationship
